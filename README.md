# Swiper
Swiper is a resource pack for Minecraft Java Edition that works as an add-on for Compliance 32x.
It changes the default fox texture to look like Swiper.

### How to Install
You have to download this resource pack and [Compliance 32x](https://compliancepack.net/downloads).
After you have placed both packs in your resourcepacks folder, select both of them.
It is important that the add-on is on top of the Compliance pack!
